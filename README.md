# Lab02 - Perceptron: Book Popularity Prediction  

This project implements a **Perceptron algorithm** to predict whether a book will be **Popular** or **Not Popular** based on:  

- **Author Popularity (1‚Äì10)**  
- **Number of Reviews**  

The program trains the perceptron, shows the **learning progress**, then allows the user to test a new book and see its position on the decision boundary plot.

## üöÄ Program Flow
1. **Training Phase**  
   - The perceptron learns from training data.  
   - A plot of **errors per epoch** is displayed to show learning progress.  

2. **User Input**  
   - The program asks for:  
     - Author popularity (1‚Äì10)  
     - Number of reviews (‚â• 0)  
   - The perceptron makes a prediction:  
     - üü¢ **Popular**  
     - üî¥ **Not Popular**  

3. **Visualization**  
   - The decision boundary is displayed.  
   - Existing books are shown in **red (Not Popular)** or **green (Popular)**.  
   - The new book is highlighted as a **large star (‚≠ê)**:  
     - Green star ‚Üí Popular prediction  
     - Red star ‚Üí Not Popular prediction

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-link>
   cd Lab02
2.Install requirements:
 pip install numpy matplotlib
3.Run the program


## Learning Outcome

From this exercise, I learned how to:

Train a perceptron and observe its learning progress.

Use decision boundaries to separate data into classes.

Accept user input to test new predictions.

Visualize predictions clearly with colors and markers.
